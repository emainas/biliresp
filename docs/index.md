# biliresp

Utilities for analyzing RESP log output and ESP grids. The project wraps the RESP parser, a linear ESP charge fitting solver, and dipole validation helpers with friendly tests and scripts.

Use the navigation to find quick-start installation instructions and focused walkthroughs for the two shipped command-line entry points:

- Fitting charges with the linear ESP solver.
- Cross-validating dipoles between RESP and fitted charges.
