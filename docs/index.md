![Electrostatic potential for biliverdin](docs/img/profile.png)

Utilities for analyzing electrostatic potential (ESP) outputs. The project includes a RESP parser for Terachem, a linear-ESP (raw, unrestrained) charge constraint optimization solver, and dipole validation helpers with friendly tests and scripts.

Use the navigation to find quick-start installation instructions and focused walkthroughs for the two shipped command-line entry points:

- Fitting charges with the linear ESP solver.
- Cross-validating dipoles between RESP and fitted charges.
